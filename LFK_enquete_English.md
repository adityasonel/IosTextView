## Q2. Please respond to the following question.

### What are the specific kind of work you wish to pursue in LINE?

I would like to work on related to js. This technology is having a great potential in it with the power and wisdom of the javascript. Also I am currently working on a project related to AR/VR, if I can work on AR/VR technology at LINE it will be a great oppurtunity for me.

### Among the apps you are currently using, which ones are you particularly interested in or using frequently? (web/smartphone apps are both acceptible; make sure to provide one frequently used app and what you have learned about in the last one year.)

For a common smartphone user, that application is very usefull by which a user can do almost every daily essential works. For me that application is "Paytm", Paytm is mutli feature application. I am using paytm for paying my bills, paying for cabs daily, booking a theathre ticket or even if I want to pay any local store directly from my bank account. So by this way I don't have to roam with the wallet full of cash all round. Paytm is very usefull application for me.

For almost 3 years ago, I started coding as android application developer at my graduation period. But as the time passes I started to work on different technologies. As in last one year I majorly work over projects related to react js or react-native. In this year I learnt the depth knowledge of working over react or react-native with state management frameworks like redux and others.

### Among the technologies you are recently interersted in, give us the name of one and the reason it draws your attention (list upto three points).

In this small career of mine I am still learning as well as I am working on many technologies. All technologies have there own structure, plus points, minus points. But I am mostly influenced with the "React JS" and the "Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality". Let first talk about "The React JS", In my views react js is like the "Doremon" of coding world. Let discuss this in points,

1. If you want to develop a website you can code on react.
2. If you want to develop a mobile application (almost every major mobile platform) you can code on react in the form of react native. 
3. If you want to develop desktop application you can code on react, using proton-native.

Now my views about AR/VR, currently I am working on a project related to AR using Vuforia SDK with Unity IDE. And I can say that, AR/VR is going to change digital world. Let take an example, currently in smartphones user getting an voice assistant with AI. Which helps user in many different ways. But just in place voice assistant if user get a 3D Model to interact instead of just a voice, it become more and more joyful and attractive for users. We can use AR/VR in our websites / smart application / smart appliances in many innovative ways. And I am sure this is going to be happen in future anytime.

### Among the projects you have worked on, which one are you  most proud of? What were your tasks in the project, and how did you use your knowledge/skills to come up with the solution?

Although I proud on my every minor or major project till date. But the most paramount project is which I am working on currently. This project is special for me because I am working first time on AR/VR technology, and I feel like AR/VR is magic.
